        The idea came to me when I was looking for extension to collect words I
        want to remember to improve my vocab in english. Found some free ways of
        doing collections + translations but they all was awful and useless.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started with small extension to save terms to the cloud data base, but
        then I remembered one methodology from the most experiences in human
        memory expert Hermann Ebbinghaus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ebbinghaus investigated human memory to find out how the learning
        mechanics work in our brain. He was pretty productive and his researches
        used worldwide to create learning products including school and
        universities programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here you can see that we need to repeat information to remember it, and
        first week is very important. So the only thing needed is to set list
        into collections and run notification to repeat information. The best
        way to learn is flipping card, but I don’t need to flip something just
        show translation or terminology and use shortcuts to decrease time loss.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I decided to investigate in market and found that there are 2-3
        projects who can help me with my problem and realised they are
        overloaded. Used one them to see the result, the result is zero, learned
        nothing in a week. Maybe because to learn words I don’t need social
        network, reward program, tons of spam in email and JS animations from
        the common library. I don’t like the design and feel they have, this is
        the application I want people to open every day let’s make it calm,
        simple, easy to use and sexy (© Elon).

      <h3>Market research</h3>
      <p>
        Markets research shows that there are a lot of potential here, traffic
        is stable and pretty high. People use them because there is no
        alternative. Application downloads impressive and they have stable
        audience but I didn’t found and communities around except Facebook pages
        but this is not the best way to get a feedback. Seems like they are
        blind to human problems and build thing they want. It is not difficult
        to grab some audience from them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I checked pricing for all solutions from the market. They are all pricy
        for the service they have, this is just a simple application, you don’t
        need a team of 500 developers to build and manage it. Just pick some
        cool technologies available today.
      </p>
      <p>
        I summed up how much I need to spend for the MVP version and I was
        surprised that I need nothing! Supabase gives me so much more then I
        need to start this project, and scale it in case it makes some profit to
        me.
      </p>
      <h3>From Idea to Release</h3>
      <p>I stared with planning in Notion and follow my regular workflow:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Idea</li>
        <li>Research</li>
        <li>Unit economy</li>
        <li>Plan</li>
        <li>Road map</li>
        <li>Tickets</li>
        <li>Heavy tasks investigation</li>
        <li>Correct the plan to exclude heavy but low priority work</li>
        <li>Start sprinting (week cycle)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        First week for investigation for technologies and find the way make it
        easy to maintain, scale and work with. I realised that I don’t want to
        build the whole service from the ground up and manage servers or so. No,
        there is much better way with Cloud Databases and Edge Functions, Static
        Hosting and JS application. Easy to build, easy to maintain, open
        sourced. Is this a dream? You can do whatever you wand by yourself, and
        it works fast, no need to set cache layers, image storages or so. All
        the stuff included, just build you dream idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        After 2 month of working I was not happy with a design, but the progress
        for the service was great. I spent more time on the UX and understanding
        of basic use cases and scenarios. The idea grows fast from simple
        application to the store for people who want's to sale their
        collections.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a plan for the year or even more in my backlog for now. I know
        how to make engagement and how to increase retention, how to up sale.
        All this connected with the theory of Ebbinghaus and I’m not gonna
        change it, this application will work customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I’m on the finish line, making alpha to publish for close testing.
        Create landing page, find a domain and right name, “wordy” is kinda
        internal name. Also I’m looking for a place to register company to get
        get money and pay taxes. In case you interested in collaborations or
        work together, then let me know at
        <a

        >.
      </p>
      <h3>Conclusions</h3>
      <p>
        I learned so much from this process. This is the best way to become
        better product manager and finally become a maker. This project gave me
        excellent experience and a vision.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I learned that ideas are nothing without experience. Experience is
        impossible without ideas. So let's have experience together in
        collaboration or follow me on this website.
